        has made a life-long study of this music. 'There are so many fascinating stories about the Christmas carols and hymns to share 
        with all of you! I know you will be delighted to hear some of these stories and sing these beloved hymns and carols. 
        A quartet of VocalEssence Ensemble Singers will join me to perform some beautiful Christmas solos and, of course, I will invite 
        you to join me in singing as we celebrate the Christmas season. And remember:  we may be inside but we sing with our outdoor voices!'">
